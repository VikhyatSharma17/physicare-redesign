                                Manual therapy, or manipulative therapy, is a physical treatment primarily used to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability; it mostly includes kneading and manipulation of muscles, joint mobilization and joint manipulation.

                                Balance and strength provide the foundation for all movement.I am always looking for balance in my clients' bodies. Inevitably, if their bodies are out of balance, then they hurt; minor aches and pains bring them down. I truly believe that balance begins with a healthy body and everything else falls into place. Simply, they feel good because balance feels good!

                                Doing everything at home is also very difficult as how much time we are spending at home, however, we want to do it whatever time we get at home but not feasible to keep all machines or big dumbbells at home. For all these reasons, a transition is taking place from conventional weight training to functional weight training which allows you flexibility doing it at any place, any time, and by easily carriable tools like resistance bands, resistance tubes loops, ropes, etc.

                                The Swiss ball has become an accepted therapeutic tool, not only in physical therapy facilities but also among personal trainers and those seeking to promote a healthy lifestyle. Swiss balls are no longer a rarity but are readily available for anyone wishing to explore their many uses.

                            <p>
                                Foam rolling is a method of self-myofascial release. Foam rollers have a short term positive impact in the range of motion of joints. Combining foam rolling and stretching does not cause a significant impact in range of motion compared to only foam rolling or stretching, but does have a superior effect in performance only if stretching is done after foam rolling.

                            <p>Muscle Energy Technique (MET) is a technique that uses a muscle's own energy in the form of gentle isometric contractions to relax the muscles via autogenic or reciprocal inhibition and lengthen the muscle. As compared to static stretching which is a passive technique in which the therapist does all the work, MET is an active technique in which the patient is also an active participant.

                                Physical therapists use various taping techniques to help relieve pain and aid in recovery. Some of the taping techniques include:

                                Cupping therapy is an alternative therapy that involves suctioning the skin with glass, plastic, or silicone cups. It may help improve blood flow, boost immune function, remove toxins, and reduce pain. Cupping is a type of alternative therapy that involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. This suction is thought to improve the flow of energy in the body and facilitate healing. Cupping has been characterized as a pseudoscience and its practice as quackery.

                            <p>
                                Postural exercises are physiotherapy exercises that can improve posture by loosening tight muscles, strengthening weak muscles, and increasing joint stability. Posture can affect health, pain, and injury risk. A physical therapist can assess posture, provide advice, and design individualized exercises based on lifestyle and needs. A physical therapy treatment program uses exercises and stretches to improve our posture. A licensed physical therapist can help you improve your posture by strengthening weak muscles that cause slouching and misalignment.
